# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is an implementation of a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB-like data objects. It provides a console interface where users can interact with various functionalities such as creating, updating, deleting, and displaying data objects.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows users to interact with the AirBnB clone functionalities. Here's how to start and use it:

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the console.py script:

```bash
$ ./console.py
where after running, the prompt "(hbnb) " is provided. this prompt allows the user to input the various methods defined in the MyConsole class that help in the execution of the interpreter. for more information, kindly run help alongside the prompt

### How to Use

Upon starting the interpreter, running help will provide all the methods defined in the console for easier usage. running each method with help provides further information on the usage of the various methods.

## Example on Usage after running ./console.py
